## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get this package working you will need to **install it via pip** (with a Python 3.6 version or higher) on the terminal by typing:

```
$ pip install investpy
```

Additionally, **if you want to use the latest investpy version instead of the stable one, you can install it from source** with the following command:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy.git@master
```

**The master branch ensures the user that the most updated version will always be working and fully operative** so as not to wait until the 
the stable release comes out (which eventually may take some time depending on the number of issues to solve).
