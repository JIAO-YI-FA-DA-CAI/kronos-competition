Since investpy is intended to retrieve data from different financial products as indexed in Investing.com, 
the **development of some support modules which implement an additional functionality based on investpy data**, 
is presented. Note that **anyone can contribute to this section** by creating any package, module, or utility that 
uses investpy. So on, the ones already created are going to be presented, since they are intended to be used 
combined with investpy:

- [pyrtfolio](https://github.com/alvarobartt/pyrtfolio/): is a Python package to generate stock portfolios.
- [trendet](https://github.com/alvarobartt/trendet/): is a Python package for trend detection on stock time-series data.

If you developed an interesting/useful project based on investpy data, please open an issue to let me know to 
include it in this section.
